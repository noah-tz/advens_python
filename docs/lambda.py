#lambda functions

#lambdas are treated identically to regular functions at the interpreter level.
#In a way, youâ€™ll say that lambdas provide compact syntax for writing functions
#that return one expression.

#can even use lambda functions with if statements. The syntax looks as follows:
#lambda <arguments> : <Return Value if condition is True> if <condition> else <Return Value if condition is False>

#a sequence. It takes 2 parameters:

#1. A function that defines how the operations to be performed on the elements.
#2. One or more sequences.
