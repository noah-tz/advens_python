    "\n",
    "## Overview:\n",
    "* AsyncIO is a library that allows the use of several functions at the same time.<br></br>\n",
    "* Async IO takes long timeouts where functions would otherwise hang and allows other functions to run during that idle time.\n",
    " (A block function effectively prohibits others from running from the time it starts until the time it returns.)<br></br>\n",
    "* Unlike threading and multiprocessing, async uses only one thread and one CPU core.<br></br>\n",
    "* Coroutines (specialized generator functions) are the heart of asyncIO in Python.<br></br>\n",
    "* Coroutines is a function that can suspend its execution before reaching return,\n",
    " and it can indirectly pass control to another coroutine for some time.\n",
    "\n",
    " ## What does it mean to be asynchronous?<br></br>\n",
    " * Asynchronous routines are able to \"pause\" while waiting on their ultimate result and let other routines run in the meantime.<br></br>\n",
    " * Asynchronous code, through the mechanism above, gives the look and feel of concurrency.\n",

    "## Basic words:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `async`: The async keyword is used to define an asynchronous coroutine.\n",
    "Will be written before the word def when writing a function.<br></br>\n",
    "* `await`: Await keyword is used to wait for a coroutine to complete.<br></br>\n",
    "* `gather`: Gather is a function that allows you to run multiple coroutines concurrently,\n",
    "and it returns an awaitable that you can await to get the results of all the coroutines."

    "* Using yield an async function is uncommon but allowed.<br></br>\n",
