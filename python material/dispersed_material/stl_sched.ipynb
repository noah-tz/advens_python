    "# sched â€” Timed Event Scheduler\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**:\tGeneric event scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sched module implements a generic event scheduler for running tasks at specific times. \n",
    "\n",
    "The scheduler class uses a time function to learn the current time, and a delay function to wait for a specific period of time. The actual units of time are not important, which makes the interface flexible enough to be used for many purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time function is called without any arguments, and should return a number representing the current time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The delay function is called with a single integer argument, using the same scale as the time function, and should wait that many time units before returning. By default monotonic() and sleep() from time are used, but the examples in this section use time.time(), which also meets the requirements, because it makes the output easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support multi-threaded applications, the delay function is called with argument 0 after each event is generated, to ensure that other threads also have a chance to run.\n",
    "\n"

    "## Running Events With a Delay\n",
